Hey, I'm Karl de Castro Fonseca, a self-taught Cloud Engineer originally from Brazil, now living in the Netherlands. I'm passionate about AWS, Security (it's always job 0!), DevOps, automation, and much more.

I'm a firm believer of continuous self improvement and that IT needs to be closer to business to deliver true value. 

ðŸ“Š **I spend my time on:**
<!--START_SECTION:time_consume-->

- Build infra through code
- Keep myself updated to see if there's innovation possible in any projects that I'm involved
- Think (and worry) about Cloud Security
- Try to find opportunities to automate workflow
- Geeking over all things AWS
- Try to learn something new each week
