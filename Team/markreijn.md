Hi, I'm Mark Reijn, a passionate self-taught, all stacks, black belted lead engineer, with a HUGE passion for automation. Proud father of two kids and in my spare time building ideas, be creative and encouraging entrepreneurship inspired by technology.

Raised with a 100% uptime philosophy, owning functionality over systems. Nowadays I believe that build for failure and resilience is  supported by the major cloud suppliers and the only path to succes in guiding your business more successful in the enablement of those capabilities.
