## What we are looking for
We will read your resume before the interview, look at the details of some of your more recent experience and formulate some questions that match your background. Basically we want to know that what you have put on your resume is true, but more than that, how you solve problems.

We love it if you tell us about things where you failed in the past, or where you feel you still need to grow and develop. None of us is the perfect engineer, but we know that as a group we are strong together. So, help us understand where you are strong and can help us and where you may need help from your peers to grow.

## How we do the interview
The interview is different for different people, but in essence, how we do it is as follows:
1. Talk about a project you are proud of from your past
   * What was your role?
   * How did you collaborate?
   * What was the main challenge?
   * What was the result?
   * If you do it again, what could be even better?
2. Talk about a failure from the past
   * What happened?
   * How did it happen?
   * What did you learn?
   * How did you deal with the failure?
3. Do a case together
   * Based on your experience we will prepare a case to walk through together
   * We want to know how you think, how you engineer, how you collaborate
   * We will work together to solve it

We might not cover all topics exactly, we know that an interview is only a moment in time, but we want to get enough of a feel for how it is to work together on these topics.
